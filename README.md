Welcome to 'The Daily Drinquiry'!

This Web Application is meant to give you a cocktail suggestion depending on how you felt your day went.
It will ask you a total of 5 questions where you will pick a choice and enter it using the 'Next' button.
Upon answering all 5 questions you will be given a cocktail based on the answers you entered. It will give
you the name of the drink you received along with a picture of the cocktail brief instructions on how to make it.

After that, the application is complete! Either take the suggestion for the cocktail and make it for yourself,
or if you aren't satisfied with the suggestion, click the 'Order Another' button and try again! Even if you input
the same answers you may get something else this  time!

Enjoy!
